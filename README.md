# MathPad Solver

## Overview

This project aims to create a Python application that can recognize and solve handwritten mathematical equations in real-time. Users can write equations using a graphical interface, and the program will recognize the handwritten text, parse the equation, solve it, and display the result.

## Features

- **Handwriting Recognition**: Uses OCR to recognize handwritten numbers and basic mathematical operators.
- **Equation Parsing**: Extracts and simplifies mathematical expressions from recognized text.
- **Real-Time Calculation**: Solves the equation and displays the result immediately.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple writing pad interface for easy user input.
